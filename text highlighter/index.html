                        <p class="fw-light text">
                            Cats purr because they have something to say, which roughly translated is “please keep still
                            and pay attention to me.” Kittens purr to persuade their mothers to keep on nursing them,
                            and pet cats purr when they want to be stroked. The vibrations emanating from the purr
                            certainly have a calming effect on people. Yet sick cats will also purr as a cry for help.
                            So purring doesn’t always mean “I’m happy.” Some researchers have claimed that the
                            vibrations from purring might help heal bone damage in an injured cat.

                        <h4 class="fw-normal text">How do they purr?</h4>
                        <p class="fw-light text">
                            The purr is an unusual vocalization, made by rattling the vocal cords together rather than
                            vibrating them by pushing air past them, which is how cats—and humans—generate all their
                            other vocal sounds. That’s why cats can purr when they’re breathing in and breathing out.
                            Most species of wildcats can purr, including the cheetah. The exceptions are the big
                            cats—lion, tiger, jaguar and leopard—whose voice boxes are modified so that they can roar.
